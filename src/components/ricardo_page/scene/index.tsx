          2. Building the scene
        </div>
        <p>
          I&apos;m going to use Blender to compose the 3D models. The first
          hurdle is importing the VariDesk model.
          It&apos;s in&nbsp;<Link to='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.dwg'>dwg</Link>
          &nbsp;format, so I&apos;ll need to use a plugin.
          I&apos;m going to follow&nbsp;
          <Link to='https://all3dp.com/2/dwg-blender-import-files/#google_vignette'>
            this blog post</Link> to figure out how this is done. Here we go!
        </p>
        <img style={styles.image} src={PreferencesScreenshot} alt='Edit -> Preferences menu.' />
        <p>
          I&apos;m going to enable the Import DXF Add-on. Unlike the blog post,
          I won&apos;t need to enable exporting as I won&apos;t be exporting
          DXF.
        </p>
        <img style={styles.image} src={AddonsScreenshot} alt='Enabling Import DXF Add-on' />
        <p>
          Also, the blog post doesn&apos;t recommend one particular tool to
          convert DWG to DXF. When possible, I try to use the most official tool.
          This appears to me to be the&nbsp;
          <Link to='https://www.opendesign.com/guestfiles/oda_file_converter'>
            Open Design Alliance&apos;s. DWG-DXF converter. </Link> I&apos;m running
          EndeavourOS so I&apos;ll have to use the AppImage. After some trial and error,
          I was able to make 2018 ASCII DXF work.
        </p>
        <img style={styles.image} src={ODAConverterScreenshot} alt='ODA Converter' />
        <p>
          I&apos;ll import this into Blender - here is the start of the scene!
          <img style={styles.image} src={BlenderScreenshot} alt='Initial Scene' />
          Next I want to import the microphone - but first I learned about&nbsp;
          <Link to='https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/scene_layout/collections/collections.html'>
            Blender collections </Link>. I&apos;ll create a collection for the desk so the
          pieces don&apos;t get mixed up.
        </p>
        <img style={styles.image} src={CollectionsScreenshot} alt='Collections' />
        <p>
          From now on, I&apos;ll create collections <em>before</em> importing,
          so things stay tidy. I&apos;ll import the microphone model next and
          use the move tool to place it on the desk.
        </p>
        <img style={styles.image} src={MicrophoneScreenshot} alt='Microphone on desk' />
        <p>
          The desk looked a bit weird, so I wanted to simplify the geometry. I
          started by reading
          <Link to='https://all3dp.com/2/blender-simplify-mesh-simply-explained/'>
            this blog post </Link>, and ended with a slightly different solution - I
    could use this object menu to join everything in the collection into a
    single object. I now also know I can use the Decimate modifier to
    reduce the number of faces later if I need to.
        </p>
        <img style={styles.image} src={JoinScreenshot} alt='Joining objects menu' />
        <p>
          Getting the keyboard up was a wild ride - it was a
          <span style={styles.inlineCode}>.blend</span> file, so I had to link
          the two files. I couldn&apos;t get the keyboard to link into my
          drawing, so I did the reverse and linked all of my objects into the
          keyboard&apos;s file. I had to scale the keyboard up by 20x so it
          would be a realistic size.
        </p>
        <img style={styles.image} src={KeyboardScaleScreenshot} alt='Now with keyboard' />
        <p>
          Next is the mouse. This one was also a
          <span style={styles.inlineCode}>.blend</span> file, and included some
          additional stuff besides the mouse. I&apos;ll remove this and group
          everything else into a single object and collection so I can easily
          link it. I&apos;ll use Object -&gt; Join to do this once again. Then
          I can link the mouse into the scene.
        </p>
        <img style={styles.image} src={MouseScreenshot} alt='Now with mouse' />
        <p>
          Now, I&apos;d like to render an image to make sure this will look good
          before proceeding. I try to render and see there is no camera in the
          scene, so I will add one. This is done by pressing Shift+A and selecting
          Camera.
        </p>
        <img style={styles.image} src={AddCameraScreenshot} alt='Adding a camera' />
        <p>
          After some trial and error with moving the camera, I was able to make a
          good render. The desk needs some textures. Everything else looks great
          so far.
        </p>
        <img style={styles.image} src={FirstRender} alt='First render' />
        <p>
          Next, I&apos;ll add the Macbook Pro. I made two changes - first, I
          deleted a nested collection that was unneeded, then I scaled it up by
          4x to make it a more realistic size.
        </p>
        <img style={styles.image} src={SecondRender} alt='Second render' />
        <p>
          Next is the monitor - this came as a <span style={styles.inlineCode}>
          .fbx</span> file, so all I need to do is import, move, and scale it.
          Let&apos;s look at the next render.
        </p>
        <img style={styles.image} src={ThirdRender} alt='Third render' />
        <p>
          Now, I&apos;m going to add textures to the desk. I realized I made a
          mistake aggressively joining objects - now it&apos;s not easy to apply
          different materials to different parts of the desk. I&apos;ll have to
          join them separately. I&aposll reopen this file, reimport the DXF, and
          split it into four groups.
        </p>
        <img style={styles.image} src={FourGroupsScreenshot} alt='Four groups' />
        <p>
          To add the top texture, I edited the top&apos;s material by clicking it
          and going to the Shader tab. I added a wave texture and applied some
          color curves until it looked like wood to me.
        </p>
        <img style={styles.image} src={DesktopTexture} alt='Desktop texture' />
        <p>
          I applied the default Plastic texture to the buttons, and the default
          Metal texture to the legs. I&apos;ll render again to see how it looks.
          This time I&apos;ll use the Cycles renderer instead of Eevee.
        </p>
        <img style={styles.image} src={FifthRender} alt='Fifth render' />
        <p>
          Now it&apos;s time to get this onto the web. We&apos;ll begin by
          exporting to glTF. Alas, we get an error message.
        </p>
        <img style={styles.image} src={ErrorMessageScreenshot} alt='Error message' />
        <p>
          The computer case was the most complex model, so I figured changing it
          could help. I went in and grouped as many objects as I could. I also
          learned that glb is like glTF but using binary instead of JSON. I was
          able to export thanks to the changes I made, and have a more efficient
          format thanks to glb.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yikes! The file is 82MB. I&apos;ll need to reduce the file size.
          I can use compression to do this - I&apos;ll start with the default of
          6, which reduced the file size to 23M. That&apos;s good enough for now.
        </p>
        <img style={styles.image} src={ExportCompressionScreenshot} alt='Export compression' />
      </div>
      <div style={styles.heading}>
        3. Getting the scene into the React app
      </div>
      <p>
        To get the scene into the React app, we&apos;ll use a tool called
        <Link to='https://github.com/pmndrs/gltfjsx'> gltfjsx </Link>. This will
        transform the scene and provide a React component for us. I run the
        following command:
      </p>
      <p style={styles.codeBlock}>
        npx gltfjsx desk_scene.glb --transform -t
      </p>
      <p>
        This gives me a file called <span style={styles.inlineCode}>
        desk_scene-transformed.glb</span> and a React component called
        <span style={styles.inlineCode}>DeskScene</span>. I&apos;ll import this
        into the project. The transformed glb file is now only 12 megabytes.
        Unfortunately the textures don&apos;t work. I&apos;ll have to add them
        using Three.js.
      </p>
      <img src={NoTexturesScreenshot} alt='No textures' />
      <p>
        I&apos;s grab a picture of wood from
        <Link to='https://freestocktextures.com/texture/wooden-plank-floor,1661.html'>
        Free Stock Textures </Link> and use it as a texture.
      </p>
      <img style={styles.image} src={Wood} alt='Wood texture' />
      <p>
        Unfortunately, this only seems to turn the desk brown. I&apos;ll have to
        try something else.
      </p>
      <p>
        Additionally, the PC didn&apos;t render very well as it is a very
        complex model. I&apos;ll replace it with the second, simpler model I
        downloaded.
      </p>
      <img src={FirstOnWeb} alt='Wood texture fail' />
      <div style={styles.heading}>3. Fixing the textures</div>
      <p>
        From the
        <Link to='https://threejs.org/docs/#manual/en/introduction/FAQ'> Three.js documentation </Link>
        , the best format to use is glTF. However, the textures didn&apos;t
        work for me initially. I learned two key things that helped:
        <ol>
          <li>The texture <em>must</em> use a Principled BSDF shader.</li>
          <li>
            The texture should be UV mapped in what the Blender documents call the
            <Link to='https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/modeling/meshes/uv/unwrapping/index.html'>
              &ldquo;proper&rdquo;
            </Link> way to use UV textures.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>
      <p>
        <Link to='https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.80/addons/io_scene_gltf2.html#uv-mapping'>
          This page
        </Link>
        of the Blender documentation was critical in learning how I needed to accomplish this.
        Using a Principled BSDF shader was straightforward in the Blender interface,
        I had not used UV mapping for the purposes of being compatible with glTF before.
        From the picture, we will need to create a UV map first. While the page
        doesn&apos;t specify, nodes view is in the Shader tab.
      </p>
      <p>
        So for the top of the desk, I have to begin by unwrapping the desk face.
        I&apos;ll select the desk, and go to the &ldquo;UV Editing&rdquo; tab
        in Blender.

        After a few tries, I found a combination that worked:
        <ol>
          <li>Click UV</li>
          <li>Check &ldquo;Live Unwrap&rdquo;</li>
          <li>Click UV again</li>
          <li>Point to Unwrap, then click Smart UV Project</li>
        </ol>
        <img style={styles.image} src={UvEdit} alt='UV Editing' />
      </p>
      <p>
        The mouse had some textures that did not work, so I also went into the
        Shader tab and found they were made with a PBR Uber shader. I swapped
        these out for Principled BSDF and everything is now rendering!
      </p>
      <p>
        For good measure, let&apos;s get a high quality Cycles render of the scene.
      </p>
      <img style={styles.image} src={FinalRender} alt='Final render' />
      <div style={styles.heading}>4. Final Result</div>
      <p>
        Here is the final result! Some things can still be improved, and now we
        have the tools to do so.
      </p>
      <div><DeskScene /></div>
    </div>
  )
}

export default Scene
